3. Bike Sharing

Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data. The dataset contains 17389 instances and 16 attributes.
